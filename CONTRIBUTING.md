                                        ## Code Style Guidelines

                                        We follow these conventions to keep our codebase clean and consistent:

                                        - **Python**: Follow PEP 8 with a line length of 100 characters
                                        - - **Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting
                                          - - **Linting**: Use `ruff` for linting
                                            - - **Type hints**: Add type annotations to all public functions
                                              - - **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
                                               
                                                - ```bash
                                                  # Format code
                                                  black cogniwork/

                                                  # Lint code
                                                  ruff check cogniwork/

                                                  # Type checking
